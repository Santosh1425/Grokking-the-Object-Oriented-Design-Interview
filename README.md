# Grokking-the-Object-Oriented-Design-Interview
Object-oriented design has always been a critical part of the software engineering interview process. Most of the engineers struggle with the object-oriented design interviews (OODI), partly because of their lack of experience in laying down the design of a complex system, and partly because of the unstructured nature of OODI. Even engineers, who have some sort of experience in building such systems are not comfortable with these interviews. It is mainly because of the open-ended nature of the design problems that don't have a standard answer. This course is a complete guide to master the OODI. It is designed by the hiring managers of Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Amazon. It not only has a set of carefully handpicked case studies, which have been repeatedly asked at the top tech companies, but also provides a thorough experience to handle different object-oriented design scenarios
